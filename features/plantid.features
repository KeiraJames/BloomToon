Feature: Plant Identification via Image Upload
	As a plant enthusiast
	I want to upload a picture of a plant
	So that I can identify its species

Scenario: Successful Plant Identification
	Given I press the + sign on the profile page
	Then a pop-up page with option to upload a plant picture appears
	When I upload a clear image of a plant with distinguishable features
	Then the system processes the image using pre-trained models
	And the system provides the correct name of the plant species within 15 seconds
	When I click save on the bottom
	Then the plant is added to my profile and stored in the database 
	And return to the profile page
	And now it can be viewed in my profile

Scenario: Image Upload with Poor Quality
	Given I press the + sign on the profile page
	Then a pop-up page with option to upload a plant picture appears
	When I upload a blurry or low-quality image of a plant
	Then a system prompts with "upload a better quality image for accurate identification" appear

Scenario: No Plant Detected in Image
	Given I press the + sign on the profile page
	Then a pop-up page with option to upload a plant picture appears
	When I upload a image that does not contain a plant (e.g., an image of a rock, landscape, or abstract image)
	Then a system prompts with "No plant detected in the image upload an image with a plant" appear

Scenario: Image of a Plant that is not in the system 
	Given I press the + sign on the profile page
	Then a pop-up page with option to upload a plant picture appears
	When I upload a clear image of a plant with distinguishable features
	Then the system processes the image using pre-trained models
	And the system does not have data in its existing databases for the plant
	Then the system prompts with “There is currently no information about this plant” appear
