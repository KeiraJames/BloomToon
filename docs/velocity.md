## Purpose

This document outlines the criteria and scale used by our team to assign story points to user stories. Story points are used to estimate the effort required to implement a user story, aiding in sprint planning and tracking team velocity.

## Story Point Scale

We use the following scale to assign story points:

| Story Points | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1            | Very Small: Minimal effort; can be completed quickly. |
| 2            | Small: Low effort; straightforward tasks.           |
| 3            | Medium: Moderate effort; may involve some complexity. |
| 5            | Large: Significant effort; includes multiple steps or moderate complexity. |
| 8            | Very Large: High effort; complex tasks requiring substantial work. |
| 13           | Extra Large: Extensive effort; involves significant complexity or multiple components. |

## Criteria for Assigning Story Points

When assigning story points, we consider the following factors:

- **Complexity**: Evaluate how complex the task is. (Does it require new technology or unfamiliar skills?)
- **Effort**: Estimate the amount of work required. (How many hours or days will it take to complete?)
- **Dependencies**: Identify if the task depends on other tasks or external factors.
- **Uncertainty**: Assess how much is unknown about the task. (Are there unclear requirements or potential risks?)
- **Business Value**: Consider the importance of the task to the project's goals.

## Guidelines we will follow:

- **Relative Estimation**: Compare the user story to others previously estimated. Use past experiences to gauge the effort required.
- **Team Collaboration**: Engage the entire team in the estimation process to leverage diverse perspectives and expertise.
- **Avoid Over-Analysis**: Focus on providing a quick, approximate estimate rather than a detailed analysis.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly revisit and adjust story point assignments based on feedback and completed work.

## Calculating Velocity

Team velocity is calculated by summing the story points of all fully completed user stories in a sprint. For example, if a team completes user stories with 3, 5, and 8 story points, the sprint velocity is 16 points.

To calculate average velocity over multiple sprints:

1. Sum the total story points completed across all sprints.
2. Divide by the number of sprints.

This average helps predict how much work the team can handle in future sprints, aiding in more accurate sprint planning.


By adhering to these guidelines, our team aims to maintain a shared understanding of task complexity and effort, leading to more effective planning and execution.
