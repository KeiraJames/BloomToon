## **Key Features**

### 🌸 **Case 1: Plant Care Comics**
- **Description:** Users upload a picture of their plant, and Bloomtoon generates a personalized care guide in the form of a comic strip.
- **Steps:**
  1. Users upload a picture of their plant.
  2. The app identifies the plant species and its care requirements.
  3. A comic strip is generated with care tips, including watering needs, sunlight exposure, and common plant issues.
  
### 🌿 **Case 2: Interactive Chatbot for Plant Help**
- **Description:** The interactive chatbot allows users to ask plant-related questions and receive illustrated answers in a comic format.
- **Steps:**
  1. Users type a plant care question (e.g., “Why are my leaves turning yellow?”).
  2. The chatbot retrieves the relevant answer and responds with a comic-style visual explanation.
  3. Users can explore more related topics or save answers for future reference.
  
### 🌾 **Case 3: RAG-Based FAQ System**
- **Description:** The app provides users with reliable, fact-based plant care answers via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
- **Steps:**
  1. Users browse or search for common plant care questions.
  2. The app fetches accurate answers using its RAG system, offering insightful plant care guidance.

### 🍃 **Case 4: Plant Vitals via Raspberry Pi (Side Project)**
- **Description:** Users can monitor real-time plant health by setting up a Raspberry Pi to gather data on plant vitals, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light exposure.
- **Steps:**
  1. Users connect a Raspberry Pi with sensors to monitor their plant's vitals.
  2. The app receives data from the Raspberry Pi and displays it in a comic-based format, offering insights into the plant's health.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Image Recognition:** For identifying plant species from photos.
- **Comic Generation:** Leveraging AI-driven text-to-image models (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion).
- **Chatbot Integration:** For dynamic, illustrated plant care Q&A using language models (e.g., GPT-4).
- **RAG System:** For retrieving plant care information from a knowledge database.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration:** For monitoring and displaying real-time plant vitals such as soil moisture, temperature, and light levels.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for building a user-friendly web application interface.
- **Backend:** Python for data processing and model training, with potential use of MongoDB or Weaviate for storing plant care knowledge.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
